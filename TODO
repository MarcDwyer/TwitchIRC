✔ Make messages local. If they're global it may cause unneeded rerenders. Find an alternate path @started(23-10-03 21:14) @done(23-12-13 22:35) @lasted(10w1d2h21m57s)
✔ Pause chat when scrolling @done(23-12-13 22:35)

Ideas
# broadcast to all
# scroll horizontally on joined tabs
# add include notification
# add @{username} with autocomplete (maybe use a tri data structure)
# add functions to send custom twitch messages (ircAction)
# finish mentioned
